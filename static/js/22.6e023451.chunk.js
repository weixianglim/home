This eliminated the need for our artists to manually draw each level since a single spritesheet can be sliced via OpenGL and used to paint multiple levels. It also ensures that no redundant resources were loaded; a few select texture buffers are enough to fully cater for multiple environments. Tilemaps also provided the added advantage of spatial optimization. As the maps are tiled, we can choose to only render tiles within a certain radial range of the player character. So even if our maps are way larger than the viewport, all unnecessary tiles were not processed by the GPU with this new tilemapping system. After this implementation, our framerate drastically improved from 20+/30 FPS up to 100+ FPS."]}),Object(O.jsx)("img",{src:b,alt:""}),Object(O.jsx)("h3",{children:"Catering for character animations"}),Object(O.jsx)("p",{children:"The process of messing around with the texture coordinates in the tilemap system led me to create another crucial system in our engine - the animation handler.
