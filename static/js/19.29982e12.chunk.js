The player, a ghost fish, has the ability to possess any other fish within the vicinity to get them out of harm's way.

We were very confident that we will be able to develop a fun and engaging game without complex or bloated game mechanics. We also wanted a little twist and stray away from the usual game tropes. Instead of destroying enemies, we wanted to explore the idea of protection.

To help mitigate the workload of a small team, we were provided a framework to aid with the graphics environment and windows creation for our project.

Even though this ended up being more time-consuming, it ended up paying off as we had more low-level control when it comes to manipulating texcoords for our spritesheets and debugging.
