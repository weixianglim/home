The game was developed as a solo project for one of my modules taken in Spring. In this final project, a central theme was chosen and a creative piece will be designed around this central theme in any desired medium. The theme for this project is "Sexuality", and I\'ve decided to use a game as a medium for this creative project. A game has a very unique trait that the other mediums do not provide - player interaction. I took advantage of this by employing "choice" as a central pillar of the game.'}),Object(r.jsx)("h3",{children:"Challenges"}),Object(r.jsx)("p",{children:"The biggest challenge I faced during development was time constraint and a lack of resources. The available development time for this project was very short. I only had approximately 2 weeks to create the entire game from scratch. On top of that, this is a solo effort with no artists to create assets for the game. I was also swamped with many other mods during this period and was developing another game, Apotcalypse, simultaneously. In light of these circumstances and constraints, I have decided to use simple shapes (cubes, spheres, etc.) for the game's characters, props and environment. This eliminated the need for me to create art assets from the ground up. As the environment is dark, I can utilise Unity Engine's lighting and shader effects to still make the game look very asthetically appealing."}),Object(r.jsx)("h3",{children:"Game Idea"}),Object(r.jsx)("p",{children:"Trapped is a top-down game happening in a dark environment. Only a small window of \u201clit-up\u201d view will be available to the player, everything outside this view window will be intentionally dark. As players maneuver through the environment, they will encounter bright blue and pink glowing objects that they can pick up. Selecting the pink one destroys the blue one (and vice versa). Once a glow object is picked, a path will be lit up to guide the player along that path. The game would have 2 different endings, the blue ending (led by the blue objects) and the pink ending (led by the pink objects). The goal of the game was to reach one of the 2 endings."}),Object(r.jsx)("h3",{children:"Reason Behind The Concept"}),Object(r.jsx)("p",{children:"A \u201cdark maze\u201d was chosen to simulate a \u201cdark closet\u201d that the protagonist is trapped in. I want to invoke a sense of the protagonist \u201cexploring his sexuality\u201d and a maze caters for this perfectly. The blue (male) and pink (female) objects are synonymous to the choices that he makes while exploring his sexuality \u2013 does he conform to the heteronormative society or stay true to himself? Additionally, texts will be splattered across the screen each time the player picks up an object to simulate the public\u2019s reactions to each choice. Picking up the blue object will invoke words like \u201cdisgusting\u201d, \u201cabsolutely horrendous\u201d, etc. while picking up the pink object will invoke more pleasant phrases like \u201cyou two look good together\u201d, \u201clovely couple\u201d, etc. These feelings would hopefully put players into the shoes of an individual who is struggling with their sexuality and facing public / social stigmatization along the way. The main goal of the game is to educate and expose players to the topic while gaining empathy in the process."}),Object(r.jsx)("h3",{children:"The Pink Route"}),Object(r.jsx)("p",{children:"If players consistently choose the pink route, they will soon find themselves at a cutscene involving 2 blue characters on one side, and a pink character on the other. Shortly after, one of the blue characters separates itself from the other and begins to move towards the pink one. An explosion will soon follow and all 3 entities will no longer be in the scene after the explosion settles down. There are many real-life examples of gay couples confirming to society and separating from their partners to be in a straight relationship. Naturally, these situations usually don't go very well. Separation rates are high in these scenarios as quite clearly, one party can never commit to the relationship as much as the other can. As a result, families and relationships are often torn apart. This cutscene aims to highlight this issue."}),Object(r.jsx)("h3",{children:"The Pink Ending"}),Object(r.jsx)("p",{children:"As players continue to follow the pink route, they will arrive at the pink ending. This ending will happen inside of the maze, and the game would portray the protagonist surrounded by houses and cars before the screen fades to black and white.

He is also still stuck in the dark maze, implying that he is still trapped in the closet."}),Object(r.jsx)("h3",{children:"The Blue Route"}),Object(r.jsx)("p",{children:"If players consistently choose the blue route, they will find themselves arriving at a room with very tranquil background music.

A body of water around the bridge can be seen, and another blue character will be waiting at the end of the bridge. This time, the screen will not fade to black and white and will remain brightly colored. This ending was chosen to draw a steep contrast of the large vast seas compared to the claustrophobic maze that the player was in just moments before.

Thinking back, I also really appreciate the fact that this is an individual project. I am working on a rather touchy subject and it would be extremely hard to convince my classmates to be on board the idea.
