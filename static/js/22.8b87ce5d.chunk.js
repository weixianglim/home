The theme for this project is "Sexuality", and I\'ve decided to use a game as a medium for this creative project.

The blue (male) and pink (female) objects symbolizes the choices that he makes while exploring his sexuality \u2013 does he conform to the heteronormative society or stay true to himself? Additionally, texts will be splattered across the screen each time the player picks up an object to simulate the public\u2019s reactions to each choice. Picking up the blue object will invoke words like \u201cdisgusting\u201d, \u201cabsolutely horrendous\u201d, etc. while picking up the pink object will invoke more pleasant phrases like \u201cyou two look good together\u201d, \u201clovely couple\u201d, etc. These feelings would hopefully put players into the shoes of an individual who is struggling with their sexuality and facing public / social stigmatization along the way.
