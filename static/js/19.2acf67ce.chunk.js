Protecc is a fast-paced game which will strain the players reaction speeds and planning abilities.

The player, a ghost fish, has the ability to possess any other fish within the vicinity to get them out of harm's way. As the game progresses, special fishes will also be available which the player can possess and destroy or hinder hazards with.

Additionally, we had to develop the game in just a single semester. Given the time constraint and lack of resources, we decided to create a game with one simple mechanic - possession! Contrary to popular belief, more mechanics does not necessarily equate to a better game. We were very confident that we will be able to develop a fun and engaging game without complex or bloated game mechanics. We also wanted a little twist and stray away from the usual game tropes. Instead of destroying enemies, we wanted to explore the idea of protection. With all these in mind, the final game concept of protecting fishes via possession was born."}),Object(f.jsx)("h3",{children:"Development"}),Object(f.jsxs)("p",{children:["As the lead programmer, I had the opportunity to develop the framework and engine for the game. To help mitigate the workload of a small team, we were provided a framework to aid with the graphics environment and windows creation for our project. However, after sitting down and discussing with the team, we decided to take on the challenge of using raw OpenGL and freeglut instead. Even though this ended up being more time-consuming, it ended up paying off as we had more low-level control when it comes to manipulating texcoords for our spritesheets and debugging.

In order to create a non-uniform fish movement, we used Perlin Noise as our random algorithm to deploy the fishes. With Perlin Noise, each fish's movement cannot be easily interpreted / predicted by the player which adds to the hectic feel of the game we initially desired. We also tried a flocking behavior for the fish movement, but the clustered nature of the fishes ended up hindering the gameplay as they are too easily caught by the nets.

One of the main hazards were fishing nets, which drops from the ships patrolling above the waters. These nets have the ability to capture a couple of fishes in one go.

One way to tackle this form of hazard was to possess every fish within the indicator area and get them out of harm\'s way.'}),Object(f.jsx)("img",{src:j,alt:""}),Object(f.jsx)("p",{children:"The second way to deal with nets is via the special fish - the piranha.
